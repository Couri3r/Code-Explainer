# Code Commenting LLM

This project fine-tunes a large language model (LLM) to generate appropriate comments for uncommented code. It leverages the Hugging Face `transformers` library and `datasets` to train a Seq2Seq model that can understand code and provide meaningful explanations.

## Features
- Fine-tune an LLM for code commenting.
- Supports multiple programming languages in the training dataset.
- Streamlit interface for testing code-comment generation interactively.

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
